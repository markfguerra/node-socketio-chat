# Node-SocketIo-Chat

A web chat application written in Node.js.

This app is being built to teach myself new skills in my spare time, and it also serves as a code demo.

Technologies in use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, NPM, Express, Socket.IO, Webpack, csslint.

This project began as an implementation of the tutorial at http://socket.io/get-started/chat/
but it has grown organically from that start point. The tutorial author's implementation at https://github.com/rauchg/chat-example. The tutorial was finished at commit dec9811 

Paul Guerra is guiding me in this exercise, in part by helping to choose what to work on next.
